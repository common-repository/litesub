Litesub helps you to add subscription popups and send newsletters in WordPress.

== Description ==

[Litesub](https://litesub.com) is a simple service that helps professionals and small businesses build subscription popups and publish newsletters. With this plugin, you can create and add a popup to your site in minutes, with least effort and no coding. Then you can create newsletters in the same way you write posts or building pages. Litesub will deliver them for you, handle the unsubscriptions, and track the opens.

In your newsletter, you can choose the posts you want to send to the subscribers. They will be listed in the newsletter and presented in your site's theme. Now you can easily build elegant newsletters like those big companies do.

At this moment, Litesub delivers newsletters with Gmail API, so you will need a Gmail/Gsuite account. More delivery methods like SMTP, Mailchimp, will be added soon.

Litesub is free if you have less than 2000 subscribers, and depending on your Gmail account type, can send at most 500 or 2000 mails for you per day.
